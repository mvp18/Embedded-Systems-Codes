# Embedded-Systems-Codes

This repository contains C codes and accompanying reports for integrating a variety of sensors with an Arduino board. The experiments were done as a part of the course [Embedded Systems Laboratory](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~debdoot/courses/EE39004/Spr2019/) (EE39004) during Spring'19.
